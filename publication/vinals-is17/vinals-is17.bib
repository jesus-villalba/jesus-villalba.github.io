 abstract = {This work presents a new strategy to perform diarization deal-ing with high variability data, such as multimedia information in broadcast. This variability is highly noticeable among do-mains (inter-domain variability among chapters, shows, gen-res, etc.). Therefore, each domain requires its own specific model to obtain the optimal results. We propose to adapt the PLDA models of our diarization system with in-domain unla-beled data. To do it, we estimate pseudo-speaker labels by un-supervised speaker clustering. This new method has been in-cluded in a PLDA-based diarization system and evaluated on the Multi-Genre Broadcast 2015 Challenge data. Given an au-dio, the system computes short-time i-vectors and clusters them using a variational Bayesian PLDA model with hidden labels. The proposed method improves 25.41% relative w.r.t. the sys-tem without PLDA adaptation.},
