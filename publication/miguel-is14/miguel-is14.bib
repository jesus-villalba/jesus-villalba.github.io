 abstract = {Factor analysis is a method for embedding high dimensional data into a lower dimensional factor space. When data are multimodal we use mixtures of factor analyzers (MFA), which assume statistically independent samples. In speaker recogni- tion, samples are not independent because they depend on the speaker in the utterance. In joint factor analysis and i-vectors, theMFA latent factors are tied at different levels. For example, they can be tied for a segment to extract utterance level informa- tion. Tied MFA approaches usually present the drawback that computing the exact posterior of the hidden variables (compo- nent responsibilities and latent factors) is unfeasible. For JFA, the preferred approximation consists in computing the respon- sibilities given a speaker independent GMM and they are fixed during the rest of the process. That implies that the estimated responsibilities for a given sample are independent of the rest of the samples of the utterance not taking into account the shared speaker and channel. We present a novel approximation to jointly estimate responsibilities and latent factors based on sam- pling the latent factor space. This model differs from previous ones in the hidden variables and parameter estimation; and like- lihood evaluation. This approach was tested on the RSR2015 database for text-dependent speaker recognition Index},
