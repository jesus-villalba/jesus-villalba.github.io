 abstract = {We describe in this paper the experiences of the Johns Hop-kins University team during the inaugural DIHARD diarization evaluation. This new task provided microphone recordings in a variety of difficult conditions and challenged researchers to fully consider all speaker activity, without the currently typi-cal practices of unscored collars or ignored overlapping speaker segments. This paper includes details about research decisions made in the process of the evaluation, including explorations of training data, feature bandwidth, speech activity detection, and i-vector versus x-vector representations. The utility of sys-tem fusions and domain-specific processing are also considered. In all cases, deeper analyses are presented using the develop-ment data, for which truth labels were given during the evalu-ation, while evaluation scores are only presented for a subset of the systems. Finally, we discuss lessons learned and remain-ing challenges left for future work within the lens of this new approach to diarization performance measurement.},
