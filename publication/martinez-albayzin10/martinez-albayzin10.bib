 abstract = {This paper describes the two systems submitted to the Albayzin 2010 Language Recognition Evaluation by I3A. This evaluation is similar to the one organized by NIST every 2 years, but the languages to be recognized are those spoken in the Iberian peninsula (Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Galician and Portuguese) plus English. Both submissions are a fusion of five phonotactic and three acoustic subsystems. The only difference between them is the normalization and fusion of the scores. State-of-the art methods for Language Recognition are adapted to and investigated in the KALAKA-2 database. Our primary system was ranked in the first position of the evaluation.},
