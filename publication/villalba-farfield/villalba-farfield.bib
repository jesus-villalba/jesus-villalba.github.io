 abstract = {In this paper, we describe a system for detecting spoofing attacks on speaker verification systems. By spoofing we mean an attempt to impersonate a legitimate user. We focus on detecting if the test segment is a far-field microphone recording of the victim. This kind of attack is of critical importance in security applications like access to bank accounts. We present experiments on databases created for this purpose, including land line and GSM telephone channels. We present spoofing detection results with EER between 0% and 9% depending on the condition. We show the degradation on the speaker verification performance in the presence of this kind of attack and how to use the spoofing detection to mitigate that degradation.},
